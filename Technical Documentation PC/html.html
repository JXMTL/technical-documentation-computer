          <p>Modern computers are built from a variety of essential components that work together to process data, run programs, and store information. Each of these components serves a specific function, and understanding how they work is key to building, upgrading, or troubleshooting a computer system.</p>
          <p>This documentation will guide you through the key components of a computer system: the motherboard, CPU, graphics card, RAM, and storage devices. You'll learn what each part does and how it contributes to the overall performance and functionality of a PC.</p>

        <section id="motherboard" class="main-section">
          <header><h2>Motherboard</h2></header>
          <p>The motherboard is the central circuit board of a computer that connects all of the system’s hardware components. It is responsible for distributing power from the power supply and facilitating communication between the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripheral components such as the keyboard, mouse, and USB devices.</p>
          <p>It has sockets for the CPU and RAM, as well as slots for expansion cards like the graphics card, sound card, and network cards. The motherboard also houses the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), which controls the basic functions of the computer before the operating system is loaded.</p>
          <p>There are different types of motherboards, and each comes with its own set of features and specifications. Common motherboard sizes include ATX, microATX, and miniITX. The type of motherboard chosen will depend on the size of the PC case and the user’s requirements for expansion capabilities.</p>

          <header><h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2></header>
          <p>The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, performs the majority of the calculations needed for a computer to function. It executes instructions from programs and performs tasks such as arithmetic calculations, logical operations, and data processing. Without a CPU, a computer cannot function.</p>
          <p>Modern CPUs consist of multiple cores, allowing them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, improving overall performance. Each core is capable of processing its own instructions, making multi-core CPUs ideal for tasks like gaming, video editing, and running virtual machines.</p>
          <p>CPUs also have different clock speeds (measured in GHz), which determine how fast the processor can execute instructions. Higher clock speeds generally result in faster performance. CPUs also come with cache memory, which is used to store frequently accessed data for faster retrieval, reducing the time it takes to execute commands.</p>
          <code>CPU Core Count: 8</code>
          <code>Clock Speed: 3.6 GHz</code>

        <section id="graphics_card" class="main-section">
          <header><h2>Graphics Card</h2></header>
          <p>The graphics card, also known as the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), is responsible for rendering images, video, and animations on the computer screen. It offloads the computationally intense task of rendering visuals from the CPU, allowing the system to focus on other tasks and improving overall performance, especially for graphics-heavy applications.</p>
          <p>Graphics cards are particularly important for gaming, video editing, 3D modeling, and other tasks that require high-quality graphics rendering. They have their own dedicated memory (VRAM), which is used to store textures, frame buffers, and other data needed for rendering images and videos.</p>
          <p>There are two main types of graphics cards: integrated and dedicated. Integrated graphics are built into the CPU or motherboard, offering basic graphical performance, while dedicated graphics cards are separate components that provide much more powerful graphical processing capabilities. Dedicated graphics cards from companies like NVIDIA and AMD are popular among gamers and professionals in creative industries.</p>
          <code>GPU: NVIDIA GTX 3080</code>
          <code>VRAM: 10 GB</code>

        <section id="ram_(random_access_memory)" class="main-section">
          <header><h2>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2></header>
          <p>RAM is a form of volatile memory used by the CPU to store data that is actively being used or processed. It provides fast access to data, allowing the CPU to quickly retrieve and write information that’s needed for ongoing tasks. The more RAM a system has, the more data it can store temporarily, improving the computer’s ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>
          <p>When you run an application or open a file, the data is loaded into RAM, making it much faster to access than from a hard drive or SSD. Once the application is closed or the computer is turned off, the data in RAM is erased.</p>
          <p>There are different types of RAM, such as DDR4 and DDR5, which vary in speed and performance. The capacity of RAM is typically measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB) for high-performance systems. For most users, 8GB to 16GB of RAM is sufficient, while gamers and professionals working with large files or applications may need 32GB or more.</p>
          <code>RAM Type: DDR4</code>
          <code>RAM Size: 16 GB</code>

        <section id="storage" class="main-section">
          <header><h2>Storage</h2></header>
          <p>Storage refers to the devices used to store data long-term, such as files, programs, and the operating system. The two most common types of storage devices are HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) and SSDs (Solid State Drives).</p>
          <p>HDDs are traditional mechanical drives that use spinning disks to read and write data. They offer larger storage capacities at a lower cost per gigabyte but are slower than SSDs. SSDs, on the other hand, use flash memory to store data, making them much faster than HDDs. This speed translates to faster boot times, quicker file transfers, and overall improved system performance.</p>
          <p>SSDs are increasingly becoming the standard for modern systems due to their speed, durability (as they have no moving parts), and energy efficiency. They are available in various form factors, such as SATA, NVMe, and M.2, with NVMe SSDs being the fastest option, providing lightning-fast read and write speeds.</p>
          <code>Storage Type: SSD</code>
          <code>Storage Size: 512 GB</code>
